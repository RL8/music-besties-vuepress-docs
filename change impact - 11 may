# Sidebar Panel

The Sidebar Panel is a context-sensitive panel that slides in from the right side of the screen, providing detailed information and interaction options for individual songs within a specific music era. In v1.1, it has been redesigned to focus on song-level reviews and comments rather than era-level content, with a clear separation between personal and community content.

## Screen Overview

**Purpose:** Display a user's ranked songs within an era, allowing them to review and comment on individual songs while also accessing community feedback, all functioning as a personal music journal with social elements

**Key Changes:**
- Focus shifted from era reviews to individual song reviews and comments
- Clear separation between personal content and community content via tabs
- Simplified first view with essential information (rank, rating, comment count)
- Comprehensive detail view for each song combining personal journal and community insights

**Primary Components:**

-   PanelHeader.vue (title, back button, close button)
-   MainTabNavigation.vue (tab switching between "Your Rankings" and "Community")
-   RankingsList.vue (ordered list of songs ranked by the user)

-   **Quick Rank Selections**: Special tracking for the 3x3 format selections
-   **Validation State**: Ensures minimum requirements are met before saving

## Quick Rank Implementation

The Quick Rank feature is implemented as follows:

1.  User selects Quick Rank mode from the mode selector
2.  Interface guides user to first select exactly 3 top eras
3.  For each selected era, user selects exactly 3 top songs
4.  System validates that exactly 3 eras and 3 songs per era are selected
5.  These selections are integrated into the user's overall rankings
6.  Quick Rank selections are highlighted in the Dashboard view

## Sorting Implementation

The sorting functionality is implemented as follows:

1.  For eras on the Dashboard:

    -   By release date (oldest first \[default] or newest first)
    -   By user's personal ranking (top first or bottom first)
    -   Unranked items always appear below ranked items
2.  For songs in Edit Rankings:

    -   By position number within era (low to high \[default] or high to low)
    -   By user's personal ranking (top first or bottom first)
    -   Unranked items always appear below ranked items

## Validation Rules

Before saving rankings, the system validates:

1.  In Quick Rank mode:

    -   Exactly 3 eras are selected
    -   Exactly 3 songs are selected for each of those eras
2.  In Full Rank mode:

    -   At least 3 eras are selected
    -   At least 3 songs are selected for each of those eras

If validation fails, a helpful message guides the user to complete their selections.

# Summary of All Required Changes

Based on my analysis of the feature enhancement plan and the current documentation, here's a summary of the changes required for each document:

**README.md**

-   Add the new feature enhancements to the key enhancements list

**Sidebar Panel**

-   Revise to focus on personal reviews and comments for songs and eras
-   Support one editable review per song/era with edit history
-   Add unlimited sequential blog-like comments
-   Implement tallying of reviews and comments across users
-   Split Review & Notes tab into separate Review and Comments tabs

**Edit Rankings View**

-   Add Quick Ranking feature (3x3 format)
-   Implement mode selection between Quick Rank and Full Rank
-   Add sorting options for songs (by position or personal ranking)
-   Ensure minimum requirements for saving (3 eras with 3 songs each)

**Dashboard View**

-   Add sorting options for eras (by release date or personal ranking)
-   Update era cards to show review and comment tallies

**Support Pages (Settings, Profile, About, Legal)**
