# Accessibility Guidelines

This section documents the accessibility features and guidelines implemented in the Music Besties application. Following these guidelines ensures that the application is usable by people with various abilities.

## Standards Compliance

The Music Besties application aims to comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This includes:

- Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable
- Understandable: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable
- Robust: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents

## Color Contrast

The application uses color combinations that provide sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments.

```css
/* From styles.css */
.chip-rank-indicator { 
    background-color: #1e3a8a; 
    color: white; 
}
```

- Text colors maintain sufficient contrast with backgrounds
- Interactive elements have distinct focus states
- Color is not used as the only means of conveying information

## Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements in the application are accessible via keyboard navigation.

```css
/* From styles.css */
.chip:focus-visible, 
.tab-button:focus-visible, 
button:focus-visible, 
[tabindex="0"]:focus-visible, 
.dashboard-grid-card:focus-visible, 
.star-rating input:focus-visible + label, 
.sidebar-tab-button:focus-visible {
    outline: 2px solid #3b82f6; 
    outline-offset: 2px; 
    border-radius: 4px;
}
```

- All interactive elements have visible focus states
- Tab order follows a logical sequence
- Custom interactive elements use appropriate tabindex values
- Keyboard shortcuts are documented where applicable

## Focus Management

The application implements proper focus management for interactive elements and modal dialogs.

```css
/* From styles.css */
.chip:focus-visible, 
.tab-button:focus-visible, 
button:focus-visible, 
[tabindex="0"]:focus-visible, 
.dashboard-grid-card:focus-visible, 
.star-rating input:focus-visible + label, 
.sidebar-tab-button:focus-visible {
    outline: 2px solid #3b82f6; 
    outline-offset: 2px; 
    border-radius: 4px;
}
```

- Focus states use a 2px blue outline with 2px offset
- Focus is trapped within modal dialogs when open
- Focus is returned to the triggering element when a dialog is closed
- Focus is managed appropriately when navigating between views

## Semantic HTML

The application uses semantic HTML elements to improve accessibility and provide better structure.

```html
<!-- From index.html -->
<nav id="tab-buttons" class="-mb-px flex space-x-1 sm:space-x-2 px-4" aria-label="Tabs"></nav>
```

- Semantic elements like `nav`, `button`, `h1`-`h6` are used appropriately
- ARIA attributes are used where needed to enhance semantics
- Elements have appropriate roles and labels

## Text Alternatives

The application provides text alternatives for non-text content.

```html
<!-- From index.html -->
<button id="sidebar-close-btn" @click="closeSidebar" class="sidebar-close-btn no-hover-highlight active:bg-gray-200" aria-label="Close sidebar">&times;</button>
```

- Images and icons have appropriate alt text or aria-labels
- Emoji have text descriptions where needed
- Complex UI components have appropriate ARIA attributes

## Touch and Pointer Accessibility

The application is designed to be usable with various input methods, including touch.

```css
/* From styles.css */
.no-hover-highlight { 
    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; 
}
```

- Touch targets are large enough (at least 44x44 pixels)
- Interactive elements have appropriate hover and active states
- Custom tap highlight behavior is implemented where needed

## Screen Reader Support

The application is designed to work well with screen readers.

```html
<!-- From index.html -->
<nav id="tab-buttons" class="-mb-px flex space-x-1 sm:space-x-2 px-4" aria-label="Tabs"></nav>
```

- ARIA landmarks are used to define regions of the page
- Dynamic content changes are announced appropriately
- Form controls have associated labels
- Custom components use appropriate ARIA roles and states
