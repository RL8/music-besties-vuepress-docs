   - Environment variables required for API connections

3. **Component Structure**
   - New components for history tracking, cooldown, and social features

   - Modular architecture for better maintainability

### Migration Steps for Developers

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Add required environment variables:
     ```
     VUE_APP_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
     VUE_APP_REDDIT_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
     VUE_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
     VUE_APP_SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
     ```

2. **Data Migration**
   - Run the provided migration script to update localStorage schema:
     ```javascript
     // Example migration script
     function migrateDataToV1_1() {
       const userData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('music-besties-data') || '{}');
       
       // Add new fields with defaults
       userData.history = userData.history || {};
       userData.lastSaveTime = userData.lastSaveTime || {};
       userData.userAccount = userData.userAccount || {
         isGuest: true,
         createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
       };
       userData.privacySettings = userData.privacySettings || {
         publicProfile: false,
         showRankings: false,
         showReviews: false,
         showBesties: false
       };
       
       // Save updated data
       localStorage.setItem('music-besties-data', JSON.stringify(userData));
       
       return userData;
     }
     ```

3. **Component Integration**
   - Add new components to your application
   - Update routing to include new views
   - Implement cooldown timer in the ranking save flow

4. **Testing Considerations**
   - Test data migration with various v1.0 data states
   - Verify Reddit OAuth flow with test accounts
   - Check privacy controls across all sharing features

## Breaking Changes

While we've aimed to make the migration as seamless as possible, there are a few breaking changes to be aware of:

1. **Ranking Save Behavior**
   - The 24-hour cooldown is enforced for all ranking saves
   - This may affect automated tests or rapid editing workflows
   - Use the `bypassCooldown` flag for development environments only

2. **LocalStorage Structure**
   - Direct manipulation of localStorage is not recommended
   - Use the provided API methods to access and modify data
   - Custom implementations may need updates for compatibility

3. **Dependency Updates**
   - Vue updated to version 3.2+
   - Vuex updated to version 4.0+
   - Axios updated to version 1.0+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Rankings**
   - Clear browser cache and reload
   - Check localStorage permissions
   - Contact support if data cannot be recovered

2. **Reddit Verification Failures**
   - Ensure you're subscribed to at least one music-related subreddit
   - Check that your Reddit account is in good standing
   - Try disconnecting and reconnecting your account

3. **Cooldown Timer Issues**
   - If timer appears stuck, check your system clock
   - Clear application cache to reset timer state
   - Cooldown is per-album, so you can still edit other albums
